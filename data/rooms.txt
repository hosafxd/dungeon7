HUMAN SHELF
Your journey begins here. This is where you arm yourself to battle what makes us all HUMAN! Flaws, fears, and frailty. Are you ready to confront and conquer YOUR deepest weaknesses?
###
SLOTH
The air is heavy, time feels slower, and the room beckons you to surrender to eternal rest. Here lies the cradle of procrastination and abandoned purpose. Will you be overwhelmed to its lifeless pull, or rise up, shake off the dust, and DEFEAT YOUR LAZINESS?
###
GLUTTONY
Tables creak under the weight of endless feasts, and every bite whispers, "JUST ONE MORE" The hunger here is not just for food  it is for EXCESS! Will you drown in indulgence, or find the strength to walk away and FACE THE HUNGER WITHIN?
###
PRIDE
A chorus of applause fills the room, echoing praise that strokes your ego. Mirrors reflect your greatness, yet shadows lie low, waiting to devour your ARROGANCE. Will you stand in the blinding spotlight, or step down from the imaginary throne and discover your TRUE SELF?
###
ENVY
Mirrors surround you, showing everything you lack and what others have, what you desire. The reflections TEASE, provoking resentment. Will you let jealousy consume your heart, or shatter the illusions and embrace your OWN unique worth?
###
WRATH
The air is RAGEFUL, charged with fury. Anger swirls like a storm, ignited by whispers of betrayal and injustice. Will you unleash the destructive force within, or harness it, tempering the fire to uncover PEACE?
###
LUST
The room hums with temptation, offering fleeting pleasures and whispered promises of fulfillment. The CHARM is strong, but shortlived. Will you give in to the pull of desire, or rise above and reclaim control over your heart and mind?
###
GREED
Gold glimmers, jewels sparkle, and treasures promise everything you could ever want. But the weight of WEALTH comes with a price, YOUR SOUL! Will you hoard the riches and be consumed by GREED, or turn away and see the world beyond the glitter?
